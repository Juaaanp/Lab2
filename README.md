### Project: Lab #2 

**Description:**

This project demonstrates the concepts of object serialization and deserialization in Java, accompanied by a logging mechanism to track session activities. It utilizes JavaFX for building the application's graphical user interface (GUI).

**Key Features:**

- **Object Serialization:** Saves object data to a persistent storage (e.g., file) for later retrieval.
- **Object Deserialization:** Restores object data from a persistent storage, recreating the original object state.
- **Logging:** For Recording the session activity, such as user actions, errors, and system events.
- **JavaFX GUI:** Provides a couple of intuitive and visually appealing interfaces for interacting with the application.

**Dependencies:**

- Java 21
- JavaFX
